# Keep these lists in alphabetical order (just to avoid ordering implying anything)
# Changes to this list can be done via regular pull requests.  A generally good
# approach can be to just start reviewing pull requests - if you do that enough
# and understand the libostree code base, feel free to submit a PR to add
# yourself to one of these lists.
# Use the responsibility to merge carefully.
